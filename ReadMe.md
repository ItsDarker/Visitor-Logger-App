## üìã Flask Visitor Logger App
This is a Flask-based web application that logs basic visitor information such as IP address, user agent, screen resolution, device memory, and geolocation (via public APIs). It is designed for educational purposes, like learning about request metadata, geolocation APIs, and client-side data collection.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
Logs IP address, browser user agent, referrer header

Attempts geolocation using ipapi.co and ipinfo.io

Logs extra client-side info via JavaScript (screen resolution, battery, language, etc.)

Saves all logs in access_logs.txt

Uses a confirm.html template to display the landing page

## üßë‚Äçüíª Use Case (Ethical)
This project is suitable for:

Educational environments (cybersecurity training, self-learning)

Local network tests

Ethical hacking labs (e.g., with permission in CTFs)

### üöÄ How to Run
## 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ItsDarker/Visitor-Logger-App
cd Visitor-Logger-App
```
## 2. Install dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3 and pip installed.

pip install flask requests
```
## 3. Add an HTML template
Create a templates/confirm.html file in your project folder.

      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        resolution: screen.width + "x" + screen.height,
        language: navigator.language,
        timezone: Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone,
        network_type: navigator.connection?.effectiveType || "unknown",
        battery_level: (await navigator.getBattery())?.level * 100 || "unknown",
        charging: (await navigator.getBattery())?.charging || "unknown",
        device_memory: navigator.deviceMemory || "unknown",
        touch_support: navigator.maxTouchPoints > 0,
        device_type: /Mobi|Android/i.test(navigator.userAgent) ? "Mobile" : "Desktop",
        cookies: navigator.cookieEnabled,
        referrer: document.referrer
      })
