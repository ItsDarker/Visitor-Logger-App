## üìã Flask Visitor Logger App
This is a Flask-based web application that logs basic visitor information such as IP address, user agent, screen resolution, device memory, and geolocation (via public APIs). It is designed for educational purposes, like learning about request metadata, geolocation APIs, and client-side data collection.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
Logs IP address, browser user agent, referrer header

Attempts geolocation using ipapi.co and ipinfo.io

Logs extra client-side info via JavaScript (screen resolution, battery, language, etc.)

Saves all logs in access_logs.txt

Uses a confirm.html template to display the landing page

## üßë‚Äçüíª Use Case (Ethical)
This project is suitable for:

Educational environments (cybersecurity training, self-learning)

Local network tests

Ethical hacking labs (e.g., with permission in CTFs)

### üöÄ How to Run
## 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ItsDarker/Visitor-Logger-App
cd Visitor-Logger-App
```
## 2. Install dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3 and pip installed.

```bash
pip install flask requests
```
## 3. Add an HTML template
Create a templates/confirm.html file in your project folder.

Example:
```bash
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Visitor Info Logged</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Thank you for visiting</h1>
  <script>
    // Example JS to send client info
    fetch('/log_client_info', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        resolution: screen.width + "x" + screen.height,
        language: navigator.language,
        timezone: Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone,
        network_type: navigator.connection?.effectiveType || "unknown",
        battery_level: (await navigator.getBattery())?.level * 100 || "unknown",
        charging: (await navigator.getBattery())?.charging || "unknown",
        device_memory: navigator.deviceMemory || "unknown",
        touch_support: navigator.maxTouchPoints > 0,
        device_type: /Mobi|Android/i.test(navigator.userAgent) ? "Mobile" : "Desktop",
        cookies: navigator.cookieEnabled,
        referrer: document.referrer
      })
    });
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

## 4. Start the server
```bash
python app.py
```
## 5. Access the app
Visit:

```bash
http://localhost:80
```

# üì° Flask App + Ngrok Setup Guide

**Educational & Ethical Use Only**

This guide helps you expose your Flask app to the internet using Ngrok, for demos or internal testing **with permission**.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This project is intended for **local testing** or **educational demonstrations** only.  
Never use this method to collect user information without **informed consent**.

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Instructions

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Start Your Flask App

Make sure your `app.py` is running on port **80**.

```bash
python app.py
```

---

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Install Ngrok

Download from [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com/download)

Then run:

```bash
ngrok config add-authtoken <your_token>
```

Get your token from: https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup

---

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Start Ngrok

Open a **new terminal** window and run:

```bash
ngrok http 80
```

Example output:

```
Forwarding    https://abc123.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:80
```

---

### ‚úÖ Step 4: Use the Ngrok URL

Open the generated link:

```
https://abc123.ngrok.io
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Only share this with people who understand and agree to what you're showing.

---

### ‚úÖ Step 5: Monitor Logs

Check the `access_logs.txt` file for visitor data.

Your Flask terminal will also show logs in real time.

---

## üîê Optional: Protect with Username/Password

```bash
ngrok http --auth "demo:password" 80
```
